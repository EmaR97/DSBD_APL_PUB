**Processing Servers:**

The processing servers play a crucial role in the distributed cam monitoring system, contributing to the efficient application of the pedestrian recognition algorithm and subsequent handling of processed images.

*Key Responsibilities:*
1. **Parallelized Processing:**
    - Multiple processing servers subscribe to the same Kafka group on a dedicated topic, allowing for workload sharing in the application of the pedestrian recognition algorithm.
    - This parallelized approach enhances the system's scalability and responsiveness.

2. **Algorithmic Processing and Image Storage:**
    - The processing servers apply the necessary pedestrian recognition algorithm to the received frames, ensuring accurate and timely analysis.
    - Processed images are then sent to MinIO for storage, creating a centralized repository for historical data.

3. **Result Reporting to Main Server:**
    - The results of the pedestrian recognition algorithm are transmitted to the main server for further storage and processing.
    - This enables comprehensive analysis and decision-making based on the detected information.

4. **Resource Utilization Metrics with Prometheus:**
    - To optimize resource utilization, Prometheus is integrated to gather essential metrics:
        - **Time Elapsed Metrics:** Capture the duration from frame creation to storing in MinIO, providing insights into processing efficiency.
        - **Work-to-Idle Ratio:** Evaluates the ratio of time spent working on frames to the idle time of processing servers, aiding in resource allocation decisions.
        - **Message Queue Metrics:** Includes the count of messages waiting on the topic for processing and the variance of this value over time. This information serves as a foundation for dynamic server deployment based on workload fluctuations.

*Dynamic Server Deployment:*
- Leveraging the gathered metrics, the system can dynamically adjust the number of deployed processing servers, ensuring optimal resource utilization and responsiveness to varying workloads.

In summary, the processing servers contribute to the distributed nature of the system, utilizing parallelized processing, optimizing resource utilization through Prometheus metrics, and facilitating dynamic scalability.


**Authentication Server:**

The Authentication Server acts as a pivotal component in the distributed cam monitoring system, providing a secure and controlled access mechanism for users and their associated cameras. Here's an overview:

*Key Features:*

1. **MongoDB Integration for User Credential Management:**
    - The Authentication Server connects to a MongoDB server to manage user credentials. This includes authentication details for users and their associated cameras.
    - Granting access privileges based on user roles and permissions ensures controlled access to the system's functionality.

2. **User Authentication and Credential Assignment:**
    - Upon successful login, the Authentication Server generates a camera password for the user. This password is then used by the associated cameras to access the system.
    - A temporary token is also provided to the user upon login, serving as an identifier for successive requests to the system.

3. **Token Verification for Request Authorization:**
    - Each request to the system includes a token, which is verified by the receiving element (e.g., processing servers). This verification is done by sending a request to the Authentication Server.
    - Access to the requested functionality is granted only upon successful token confirmation. If verification fails, access is forbidden, ensuring a secure and controlled environment.

4. **Credential Provision to Cameras:**
    - Cameras, upon successful login, receive the necessary credentials to access RabbitMQ and Kafka services. This ensures seamless integration into the distributed system for real-time communication and data exchange.

*Security Measures:*
- The use of temporary tokens enhances security by regularly updating user identification, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
- The Authentication Server serves as a gatekeeper, verifying the legitimacy of requests and ensuring that only authorized users and cameras can interact with the system.

*Integration with Other Components:*
- The Authentication Server plays a vital role in orchestrating the secure communication and interaction between users, cameras, and various system services, including RabbitMQ and Kafka.

In summary, the Authentication Server establishes a robust authentication and authorization framework, integrating with MongoDB for credential management and ensuring secure communication within the distributed cam monitoring system.



**Main Server:**

    - This centralized approach streamlines communication between different components, ensuring consistency and reliability in accessing camera details.

6. **Positive Pedestrian Recognition Notifications:**
    - Upon consuming messages related to processed images, if an image is positively recognized for pedestrians, the Main Server triggers a message to the notification topic on Kafka.
    - This message is then processed by the Notification Service, allowing users to receive timely alerts and notifications about detected pedestrian activity.

*Enhancing User Experience and System Efficiency:*
- The Main Server acts as a linchpin, providing a cohesive interface for users to manage cameras, access video feeds, and receive notifications. Its integration with Kafka enhances system efficiency and responsiveness.

   - To maintain data consistency, a singular component is responsible for accessing different document categories within MongoDB.
   - This component acts as a centralized access point, providing a streamlined approach to querying and updating data.

3. **Direct Access to Processed Frames:**
   - The Main Server facilitates direct access to processed frames stored in MinIO by generating pre-signed URLs.
   - Users can directly access the MinIO storage without intermediaries, minimizing unnecessary throughput usage and ensuring efficient data retrieval.

4. **Presigned URL Mechanism:**
   - When a user requests access to processed frames, the Main Server generates a pre-signed URL for secure and temporary access to the specific resource in MinIO.
   - This mechanism enhances security while optimizing the direct retrieval of frames by users.

*Benefits of Singular Data Access Component:*
- By designating a singular component for data access, the system ensures data consistency and avoids potential conflicts that may arise from concurrent access to the MongoDB database.
- The centralized approach streamlines data management operations and simplifies the implementation of data integrity checks.

*Enhancing User Experience:*
