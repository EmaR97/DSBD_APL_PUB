**Introduction:**

The distributed cam monitoring system represents a comprehensive and robust solution designed to address the complex requirements of surveillance and event detection. This system is built on a foundation of distributed components, each serving a specific role in ensuring the seamless capture, processing, and notification of events in real-time. Leveraging technologies such as Kafka, MongoDB, and Kubernetes, the system combines scalability, efficiency, and security to create a reliable environment for users and cameras.

At its core, the system consists of cameras deployed in various locations, capturing frames that are subsequently distributed to processing servers via Kafka. These servers, subscribed to a common Kafka group, collectively apply sophisticated pedestrian recognition algorithms and store processed frames in MinIO. The Main Server, acting as a centralized hub, manages camera information and frames, while the Authentication Server ensures secure user access. Telegram bots, facilitated by the Notification Subscription Service and Notification Service, provide a user-friendly interface for managing notifications and receiving real-time alerts.

The use of technologies like GRPC, Proto format, and the integration of Kubernetes Gateway API contribute to a secure and well-structured communication framework. The system's architecture emphasizes data consistency through MongoDB, secure access through Gateway API, and direct, optimized access to processed frames via presigned URLs.
